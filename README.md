This is the main website for Rekå Resor AB.
Featuring presentations of the current trips on sale and administrator interface were information about current trips can be easily edited.

This project is part of a trainee employment in co-operation with Lernia YH (front-end JS developer) and made by Håkan Arnoldson.

No back-end frameworks are used, this is booth for training purposed to gain a better understanding of PHP and because PHP frameworks
are a bit outside a javascript education. Also the needs for this project are very limited and re-inventing the wheel was ok in this case.

## Dependencies and frameworks used in this project
* jQuery 3.1.1 (https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* Bootstrap 3.3.7 (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
* Font Awesome 4.7.0 (https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)
